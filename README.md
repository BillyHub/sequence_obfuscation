### About

Implementation codes of the proposed obfuscation algorithms in Matlab.

#### To download the Reality Mining dataset:

http://realitycommons.media.mit.edu/realitymining.html

Then save the data file 'realitymining.mat' under current directory.

#### To sample the Reality Mining dataset, run:

```bash
sample_RealityMining.m
```

#### To test the obfuscation algorithms on i.i.d. sequences, run:

```bash
test_obfuscation_iidSequence.m
```

#### To test the obfuscation algorithms on dataset sequences, run:

```bash
test_obfuscation_dataset.m
```
