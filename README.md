### About

Corresponding code to the paper "Sequence Obfuscation to Thwart Pattern Matching Attacks" by Bo Guan and et al., at IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT) 2020. The extended version of the conference paper is accepted by IEEE Internet of Things Journal, September 2022.

Implementation codes of the proposed obfuscation algorithms in Matlab.

#### To download the Reality Mining dataset:

http://realitycommons.media.mit.edu/realitymining4.html

Then save the data file 'realitymining.mat' in the same repository.

#### To sample the Reality Mining dataset, run:

```bash
sample_RealityMining.m
```

#### To test the obfuscation algorithms on i.i.d. sequences, run:

```bash
test_obfuscation_iidSequence.m
```

#### To test the obfuscation algorithms on dataset sequences, run:

```bash
test_obfuscation_dataset.m
```
