### About

Implementation codes of the proposed obfuscation algorithms in Matlab.

#### To test the obfuscation algorithms on i.i.d. sequences, run:

```bash
test_obfuscation_iidSequence.m
```

#### To test the obfuscation algorithms on dataset sequences

First to download the Reality Mining dataset from:

http://realitycommons.media.mit.edu/realitymining.html

Then save the data file 'realitymining.mat' under current folder.

Sample the Reality Mining dataset, run:

```bash
sample_RealityMining.m
```

To test, run:

```bash
test_obfuscation_dataset.m
```
